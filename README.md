Predicting weak links in Microsoft systems for malware attacks
1.	Title: Microsoft Malware Prediction 

2.	Introduction and Statement of the Problem

•	Now a days detecting malware has been difficult and finding the potential malware has been even more. These malwares are worsening day by day and troubling not only the personal/organization systems but all the cyberspace. 
•	In order to protect the systems for malware and there by finding weak links in system architecture and to secure, this project is taken up.
•	Objective of this project is by applying advance machine learning models to find hidden patterns. Constructing infrastructure to collect data, build models and deploy models.

3.	Review of Literature

In this current Internet age malwares like virus ransomware and Trojan horse are serious an alarming security threat to the Internet users, organizations and private users. To protect users from these threat’s anti malware software products from different companies provide a major defense against the malwares. Unfortunately, the number of new malware samples has explosively increased. 
In order to keep on fighting the increase of malware samples there is an important to develop effective methods. An efficient malware detection from the real and large daily sample collection. Following the current trend and one of the most common approaches in literature using machine learning techniques it automatically learns models and patterns behind the complexity and develop functionalities to handle with malware evolution.
This project aims to provide an overview on machine learning models how they can be used in context of malware analysis in windows environment. The objective is to use multiple machine learning models especially tree models to classify the malware prediction using the given data from Kaggle. and initially with the domain knowledge removing multiple features the are insignificant for the analysis and by using statistics inferences removing few more features and thereby filling out empty relations and then training the model with the data to predict the weak link in the system that causes malware. 

4.	Objectives of the Study

To predict a Windows machine’s probability of getting infected by various families of malware, based on different properties of that machine. The telemetry data containing these properties and the machine infections was generated by combining heartbeat and threat reports collected by Microsoft's endpoint protection solution, Windows Defender.
